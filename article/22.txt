Former world champ Chen Jin retires

BEIJING: Former world badminton men’s singles champion Chen Jin has called it a day after a decade-long career.

The 27-year-old is now an assistant women’s singles coach of the Chinese national team.

It is learnt that he handed in his letter notifying the team of his retirement at the end of last month.

The team approved it and roped him in to help out the women’s singles coaching department, which has been short-staffed since Zhang Ning went on maternity leave.

He went on to win the world title in Paris in 2010. He was a member of China’s Thomas Cup-winning teams in 2006, 2008, 2010 and 2012.
