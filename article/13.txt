Masterclass by Ahmad/Natsir

There was an otherworldly calm that Tontowi Ahmad and Liliyana Natsir displayed in the Mixed Doubles final. Facing a pair of the quality of Zheng Siwei and Chen Qingchen, the World champions looked so unhurried and elegant, the occasion might well have been mistaken for anything but the final of a Superseries.

Yet, with their instinctive reading of the lines of the Chinese attack, and with Natsir coolly directing the traffic at the forecourt, the Chinese were harassed no end. The shuttle kept darting at them from unexpected angles; with soft touch and sharp cuts were the Chinese caught, always a split-second late. Even during the sticky end to the first, or midway in the second, the Indonesians radiated assurance while the Chinese had the look of soldiers fighting from the trenches. A momentary revival in the second game proved to be a passing phase, for the Indonesians were on the ball at the end, and Ahmad’s destructive smashing closed the lid on Zheng and Chen’s challenge: 22-20 21-15.

"The key to win was that we were calm and we enjoyed the match. We have beaten them before and we were confident, especially since we have won a few big titles this year," said Natsir.

"We’ve played together for a long time now, we have good communication and applied the right tactics on court. We enjoyed playing in Paris, the crowd is amazing so our mood was very positive. We’re looking forward to doing well at the Dubai Superseries Finals as that’s a title we’ve never won."
