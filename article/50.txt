Badminton: Simon Santoso to defend title at OUE Singapore Open

The Indonesian shuttler, who beat Malaysian badminton star Lee Chong Wei to the title last year, says he expects the competition to be tougher this year.

SINGAPORE: Indonesian shuttler Simon Santoso pulled off a major upset in last year's OUE Singapore Open, beating then world number one Lee Chong Wei to the Men's Singles crown.
This year, the former world number three begins his title defence against Denmark's Emil Holst in the qualifiers. The competition kicks off on Tuesday (Apr 7).

"I believe it will not be an easy task as the competition level is higher and tougher, as compared to last year's," Santoso said.
Should he clear Holst, Santoso will be up against Malaysia's Chong Wei Fong and 5th seed Viktor Axelson from Denmark - whom he noted, have been "doing well" in recent tournaments.

The Singapore Open will be held at the Indoor Stadium from Tuesday till Sunday and will feature top names such as Chen Long and Jan O Jorgensen. However, top shuttler and Olympic bronze medallist Saina Nehwal from India withdrew from the tournament on Monday, along with Indonesia's Tommy Sugiarto.

Singapore's top male shuttler Derek Wong and women's doubles pair Vanessa Neo and Shinta Mulia Sari will be using the Open as an important test ahead of the SEA Games in June.
