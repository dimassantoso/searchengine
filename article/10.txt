Badminton: Chen Long beats Axelsen to win China Open

SHANGHAI: Olympic champion Chen Long delighted the home crowd as he defeated world number one Viktor Axelsen of Denmark to win the China Open for a fourth time on Sunday (Nov 19).

The sixth-seeded Chinese emerged from a see-saw battle 21-16, 14-21, 21-13 in Fuzhou, getting the better of the world champion and top seed in 72 engrossing minutes.

The 23-year-old Axelsen has had a superb year, winning the world title and becoming the leading figure in the men's game.

But Sunday's defeat extends his poor run against the more experienced Chen, 28, who has now won eight of their nine meetings.

It was Chen's first China Open crown since 2013.

There was to be no Chinese fairytale however in the women's decider.
