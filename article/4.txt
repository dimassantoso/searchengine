Chong Wei wants coaches Hendrawan, Seu Bock to be with him in Rio

KUALA LUMPUR: World number one Datuk Lee Chong Wei who is the country’s best hope of winning a first ever gold medal at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics next month, wants his two coaches, Hendrawan and Tey Seu Bock, to be with him in Brazil.

Difficulties in securing accreditation cards for the Olympics has put the Badminton Association of Malaysia (BAM) in a difficult position to decide who would be at the court-side during Chong Wei’s matches.

For Chong Wei though, the presence of both coaches will be vital in his quest to win the gold medal.

“According to Datuk Seri Mohamad Norza Zakaria and BAM acting president Tan Sri Mohamed Al-Amin Abdul Majid who is also the Chef-de-Mission for Rio, there are problems due to limited accreditation cards provided by the organisers.

“I have requested for both coaches to be in Rio because I need both of them to analyse my matches and opponents. In the previous Olympics I was also assisted by two coaches,” said Chong Wei after a training session at the Juana Stadium in Bukit Kiara today.

The BAM had listed Indonesian coach Hendrawan, the 2001 world champion and 2000 Sydney Olympics silver medallist and Seu Bock for Rio but the International Olympic Committee (IOC) threw a spanner in BAM’s plans by approving only four accreditation cards for coaches and support staff.

BAM can still take both the coaches but one might have to sit outside the playing area.

The Malaysian badminton team to Rio comprise Chong Wei (men’s singles), Tee Jing Yi (women’s singles), Goh V Shem/Tan Wee Kiong (men’s doubles), Chan Peng Soon/Goh Liu Ying (mixed doubles and Vivian Hoo/Woon Khe Wei (women’s doubles).
