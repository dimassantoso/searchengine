Adcocks bow out of Hong Kong Open in first round

This week may mark the fourth anniversary of Chris and Gabby Adcock’s maiden Superseries title but another was not to come their way as they exited the Hong Kong Open in the first round.

In 2013, the Adcocks defeated Chinese opposition to lift the title in Kowloon, the first English players to stand atop the podium in Hong Kong since 1987.

But 2017 was not to be their year, bowing out in their opening match at the hands of Denmark’s Mathias Christiansen and Christinna Pedersen.

The Danes took first blood over the Adcocks – seeded third – winning the first game 21-12, racking up six consecutive points along the way.

The second was a much tighter affair, however, with Christiansen and Pedersen requiring two game points before edging out the Adcocks 21-19.

But while the Adcocks depart Asia empty-handed, their season is not over just yet, with qualification secured for the Dubai World Superseries Finals next month.

The year-ending tournament has seen phenomenal success for the English pair, winning in 2015 before finishing as runners-up last year.

The action will kick off in Dubai on December 13 and will be the Adcocks’ final tournament of a year in which they were crowned European champions and World Championship bronze medallists.
