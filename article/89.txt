Semi final woes for European Champions

While the day got off to the best start for Europe with Axelsen’s win that proved to be the highlight as both the Adcock’s and Juhl & Pedersen lost out in their respective semi finals to leave Europe with a single shot at gold tomorrow. 

The Danes were very lacklustre in their match against Fukushima and Hirota, a pair they have never lost to before. The Japanese pair looked stronger in every aspect and the Danes were understandably disappointed. 

“At the moment we are very disappointed, we will always be disappointed when we lose a match, however in these circumstances we never really felt quite right on court, however we are pleased with a bronze medal nevertheless.”

The Adcock’s went down fighting against Chinese pair Chen Qingchen and Zheng Siwei. A thrilling match that had the packed Emirates arena on the edge of their seats eventually went the way of the Chinese 21-15 23-21. 

"We are disappointed. First set we didn't really bring our game style, we more reacted to what they were going to bring and I think it maybe slowed us down a little too much. Second set we played how we wanted to play and didn't worry about what they were going to bring but it was too little too late." 

All the finals day action kicks off at 1pm (GMT) with Europe’s sole representative going for gold in the third match of five. Axelsen is looking for his maiden world gold while his opponent Lin Dan is looking to create history by winning his sixth.
