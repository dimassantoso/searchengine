Chong Wei on China mission to regain confidence

IT is not looking good for Lee Chong Wei, especially after suffering early exits from his last two tournaments.

A defeat in the second round of the Denmark Open and a shock first round loss at the French Open last month, clearly affected the 35-year-old's confidence.

In Odense, the former World No 1 was shown the exit by India's H.S. Prannoy, while in Paris, Chong Wei was knocked out by Japan's rising star Kenta Nishimoto.

Consequently, Chong Wei has decided to lower his expectation as he takes to the court in the China Open tomorrow, where he hopes to regain his lost confidence and desire to continue playing top level badminton.

"I felt hopeless as my confidence level was so low after the Denmark and French Opens. However, I also understand that it is only natural in sports for one to win and lose,” he said today.

"Personally, it's how I bounce back from a situation like this that matters more.

"I don't want to pressure myself. That is why, at this China Open, I have decided to focus on one match at a time and not have any high expectation.”

The three-time Olympic Games silver medallist opens his campaign in Fuzhou against Taiwan's Hsu Jen Hao. Chong Wei is also in the same half as five-time world champion Lin Dan, whom he might face in the quarter-finals.

Top seed and reigning world champion Viktor Axelsen of Denmark is also in the same half, alongside fifth seed Chou Tien Chen of Taiwan.

After the China Open, Chong Wei is slated to compete in the Hong Kong Open next week. It will be his last tournament for the year, after which he has decided to spend time with his family.

"Next year is a crucial year as there are a few important tournaments (Gold Coast Commonwealth Games, Thomas Cup, Asian Games and the World Championships). I want to rest well and make sure I am fresh for the new year," added Chong Wei.
