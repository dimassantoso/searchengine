Chong Wei sends aid to flood victims in Penang

KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysiaâ€™s iconic shuttler and former world No. 1 Datuk Lee Chong Wei took time off from his busy training and competition schedule to send aid to flood victims in Penang.

"Although I cannot be with them (flood victims), we will help whenever and wherever we can. I received a message seeking help for flood victims because whatever aid was provided was not enough.

"I have sent food and pillows to the affected areas.

"I hope such aid can ease the burden of the flood victims," he said when met at the Akademi Badminton Malaysia, Bukit Kiara, yesterday.


Strong winds and continuous heavy rain have resulted in massive floods throughout Penang, resulting in flood waters rising between 0.2 and 1m, since last Saturday.

Since Saturday, seven people have died due to floods which also hit Kedah and Perak.
