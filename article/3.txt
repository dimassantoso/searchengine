Chen Long beats no.1 Axelsen to win badminton China Open

Olympic champion Chen Long ( left ) delighted the home crowd as he defeated world number one Viktor Axelsen ( right ) of Denmark to win the China Open for a fourth time on Sunday. The sixth-seeded Chinese emerged from a see-saw battle 21-16, 14-21, 21-13 in Fuzhou, getting the better of the world champion and top seed in 72 engrossing minutes. Sunday's defeat extends Axelsenâ€™s poor run against Chen, 28, who has now won eight of their nine meetings. It was Chen's first China Open crown since 2013.
