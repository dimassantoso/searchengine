Axelsen wins his first Japan Open title and takes #1 spot

World champion Viktor Axelsen of Denmark beat Malaysia's Lee Chong Wei to clinch his first Yonex Japan Open title.

Axelsen edged out Lee 21-14, 19-21, 21-14 in the men's final. Lee narrowly took the second game but the Dane put in a brilliant performance to triumph in the third. Axelsen won in Tokio his third Superseries career title.

"I am really happy to perform at this high level after the World Championships. I think I have showed these last couple weeks that, when I play my best and I am in good place both physically and mentally, I am a strong competitor for these titles. I am really proud. My dreams are coming true, winning these tournaments, especially the World Championships and becoming world No.1 as well," said the 23-year old to BWF's website bwfbadminton.com.

"I don't like to focus too much on the world rankings. I know that if I keep my head in the game that the rankings will give me the reward. I just try to focus on the tournaments and the results and the ranking will of course follow."
