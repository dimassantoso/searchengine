Maria Kristin Yulianti: New face in women's badminton

She walks slowly onto the court with a blank face. When the match begins, she looks like she will not chase after the shuttlecock. Please welcome "Queen of three games" Maria Kristin Yulianti of Indonesia! At the age of 23 (a little older than your average Asian shuttler) Maria earned a bronze medal in the women's singles badminton competition at the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games.
