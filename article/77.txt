Son too good for Prannoy in Denmark

Giant killer H.S Prannoy’s challenge at the Denmark Open came to an end on Friday, as he went down in straight games to top seed Son Wan Ho of South Korea.

Prannoy produced a big upset on Thursday by knocking out former World No 1 Lee Chong Wei, but he proved no match for Son in the quarter-finals, going down 21-13, 21-18 in 44 minutes.

Son, who is the red hot favourite for the title, moves on to face countryman Lee Hyun Il, who beat Rajov OPuseph 24-22, 21-6.

The second semi-final will pit India’s Kidambi Srikanth against Hong Kong’s Vincent Wong Wing Ki, after both men secured upset victories.

Eighth seed Srikanth downed second seed and home favourite Viktor Axelsen, fighting back from a game down to secure a 14-21, 22-20, 21-7 victory.

Unseeded Vincent edged fifth seed Chou Tien Chen 22-20, 24-22 in a closely fought match.
