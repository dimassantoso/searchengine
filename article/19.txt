Lin Dan: The Best Chinese Badminton Player

Although Lin Dan has won all the major titles in badminton, his skills and talents in badminton is not truly reflected through the BWF World Ranking system.

This is because he has not been participating in badminton tournaments, hence losing the opportunity to obtain those precious BWF ranking points. For example, he hardly played in the 12 OSIM BWF World Super Series tournaments in 2011.

In 2011, Lin Danâ€™s world ranking has fallen dramatically. This was due to him giving the opportunity to his fellow Chinese badminton players to excel in the sport.

Despite this, he still fought hard in major tournaments such as the Badminton World Championships.

He showed great character in the first ever Super Series Premier, the Victor Korea Open in 2011.
