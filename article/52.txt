Indonesia lifts doubles team's ban

JAKARTA, Indonesia -- The Indonesian Badminton Association has lifted a ban on its leading women's doubles pair over the play-to-lose scandal at the London Olympics.

Greysia Polii and Meiliana Jauhari were kicked out of the games along with the Chinese world champions and two South Korean teams for trying to deliberately lose group matches to gain an easier path through the later stages.

The pair, along with their coach Paulus Firman, was banned for four months in September from participating in all national and international tournaments.

Association official Koesdarto Pramono says the ban was lifted Saturday. It had been initially reduced to three months on Oct. 22 after the players expressed remorse for their actions.
