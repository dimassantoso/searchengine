After Kidambi Srikanth’s disappointing loss in the Men’s Singles, it is now up to Saina to ensure that at least one Indian make it to the final of the Australian Open on Sunday. However, the task won’t be so easy for the World No.8, who will be up against an opponent who has been a nemesis of hers for a very long time- China’s Wang Yihan.You can catch all the LIVE updates here.

The two have played one another on 15 occasions across competitions and the Yihan has defeated in 11 of those matches, including a win over the Indian at the London Olympics in 2012.

The last meeting between the two was at the Badminton Asia Championships, where Yihan beat Saina in the semis 21-14 21-16. Can the Indian avenge that defeat or will Yihan win her 12th match against Saina? We will know soon.
