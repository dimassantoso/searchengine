Close but not enough

The menâ€™s doubles pair have enjoyed an almost perfect tournament but just could not get the result they would have been hoping for this evening.

The two Danes would have been awaiting their 17th Super Series title, but it just was not to be in the tight clash against their Chinese Taipei opponents.

In the first set of the final against the seventh seed in Lee Jhe-Huei and his partner Lee Yang, the Danish pair struggled to hold the lead that they got after going behind at the very start, and allowed their opponents to break them down.

Close finish
Second game was close but the Danes just couldn't take their Chinese Taipei opponents to a third game in a contest that was full of excitement but lost it in the end 23-21.

Mathias Boe and Carsten Mogensen, seeded number two will have to settle for Silver on the podium this evening, as they have just missed out on winning back to back titles in the Yonex French Open, having won it last year.

The two can certainly go home knowing that they put some great effort into the tournament and will come back again next time and maybe go one step further.
