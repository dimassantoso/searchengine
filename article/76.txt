All-Indian semi-final in Paris

India's H.S. Prannoy will face countryman Srikanth Kidambi in the semi-finals of the French Open in Paris.

With the likes of Chen Long, Lee Chong Wei and Son Wan Ho already out of the competition, Eighth seed Kidambi is now the top seed and favorite for the title.

On Friday, he pulled off an impressive upset win over fourth seed Shi Yuqi, battling back from a game down to secure a 8-21, 21-19, 21-9 result.

Prannoy, meanwhile, defeated South Korean Jeon Hyeok Jin 21-16, 21-16 in 47 minutes.

In the women's draw, top seeds Tai Tzu Ying and PV Sindhu remain alive and on course for a showdown in the final.

Tai looked in control as she beat Thai eighth seed Ratchanok Intanon 21-17, 21-12, while Sindhu had too much firepower for China's Chen Yufei, sealing a 21-14, 21-14 victory.
