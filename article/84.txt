Lin Dan to face Ginting in Swiss Open semis

Top seed Lin Dan will face Anthony Sinisuka Ginting after both players stormed into the semi-finals of the Swiss Open on Friday.

China’s Lin had too much firepower for Ihsan Maulana Mustofa, wrapping up a 21-17, 21-14 win in 47 minutes.

Indonesia’s Ginting, meanwhile, had to battle back from a game down to edge Denmark’s Emil Holst 17-21, 21-15, 21-13.

Lin and Ginting have only met on one previous occasion, two years ago, when the Chinese shuttler came out on top.

The second semi-final sees sixth seed Tzu Wei Wang take on second seed Shi Yuqi.

Tzu survived a testing encounter against Kanta Tsuneyama, winning 14-21, 21-16, 21-17, while Shi beat H.S Prannoy 21-19, 21-11.

In the women’s draw, Ginting’s countrywoman Fitriani Fitriani reached the last four with a 12-21, 21-19, 22-20 victory over Mia Blichfeldt.

She moves on to face China’s Chen Xiaoxin.

Another Chinese player, Chen Yufei, will take on Chisato Hoshi of Japan in the other semi-final.
