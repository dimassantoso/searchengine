Clean sweep for local players at China Masters

Local players dominated Friday’s quarter-finals at the China Masters, which saw all four semi-final spots go to Chinese shuttlers.

Top seed Lin Dan booked his place in the last four after dispatching Taipei’s Hsu Hen Hao 21-14, 21-14.

The two-time Olympic champion won both of their previous meetings back in 2011 and 2014, and the result was the same on Friday.

The contest was a tight affair up until 14-all, when Lin took the contest by the scruff of the neck, winning seven straight points to go one game up.

There was no way back for Hsu in the second game, which Lin controlled throughout to complete a comfortable victory.

Lin moves on to face third seed Qiao Bin, after he completed a 21-16, 22-20 victory over Kanta Tsuneyama.

The second semi-final sees second seed Tian Houwei take on fourth seed Huang Yuxiang. Tian comfortably dispatched Hsueh Hsuan Yi 21-10, 21-11, while Huang was a 21-11, 21-18 winner over Sun Feixiang.

There was an upset in the women’s draw, as local favourite and top seed Chen Yufei went down 19-21, 22-20, 21-18 to Japanese fifth seed Saena Kawakami.

Kawakami moves on to face another Chinese player, unseeded Cai Yanyan.

Also battling it out for a place in the final on Saturday are second seed Aya Ahori and eighth seed Gao Fangjie.
