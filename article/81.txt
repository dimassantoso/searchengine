China, Japan complete Sudirman Cup semi-final line-up

China and Japan will square off in the semi-finals of the Sudirman Cup after winning their respective quarter-finals on Friday.

The top-seeded Chinese team brought India’s campaign to an end as they secured a commanding 3-0 victory.

Ashwini Ponnappa and Satwiksairaj Rankireddy put up a brave fight in the opening mixed doubles contest but ultimately lost 16-21, 21-13, 21-16 in a match that lasted more than an hour.

Olympic champion Chen Long then secured a 21-16, 21-17 victory over Kidambi Srikanth in the men’s singles, before Fu Haifeng and Zhang Nan gave their side an unassailable 3-0 lead by defeating Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty in the men’s doubles.

That meant there was no need to play the next two matches, the women’s singles and doubles.

Japan, meanwhile, booked their place in the last four with a 3-1 victory over Malaysia.

Only World No 1 Lee Chong Wei was able to secure a point for the Malaysians, with Japan dominating the remaining contests.

Men’s doubles pair Takeshi Kamura and Keigo Sonada secured a surprise 17-21, 21-16, 11-21 victory over National men’s doubles pair Goh V Shem and Tan Wee Kiong.

Nozomi Okuhara then comfortably beat Sonia Cheah 21-11, 21-9 in the women’ singles, before women’s doubles duo Misaki Matsutomo and Ayaka Takahashi thumped Vivian Hoo and Woon Khe Wei 21-7, 21-14.

The second semi-final sees South Korea take on Thailand. The two teams booked their places in the last four following their respective quarter-final victories on Thursday.
