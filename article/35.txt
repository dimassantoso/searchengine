Adcocks bounce back to advance to China Open second round

Chris and Gabby Adcock’s bid to regain a place in the world top five continues after an opening round victory at the Tahoe China Open.

The third seeds came back from a game down to defeat Chinese Taipei’s Wang Chi-Lin and Lee Chia Hsin 19-21, 21-14, 21-13 at the BWF Superseries tournament in Fuzhou.

The Adcocks reached a career-high ranking of fourth in the world after winning World Championship bronze in August, but have slipped to sixth in recent weeks.

They had never faced Wang and Lee before and the unfamiliarity showed as they narrowly lost the first game.

But the English shuttlers soon found form, winning the next two games in convincing fashion to set up a second-round showdown with Japan’s Yugo Kobayashi and Misaki Matsutomo.

However Rajiv Ouseph did not enjoy such success in the men’s singles, losing 12-21 21-10 21-12 in a tough opening match against fourth seed Shi Yuqi.

The reigning European champion began the first-round clash in dominant style to take the first game, but the tables soon turned as former world junior champion Shi closed out the match.

Ouseph had never lost against the Chinese shuttler, beating him in straight games at the Denmark Open just last month.

But there was little the 31-year-old could do in the face of Shi’s dominant performance in the second and third games, fuelled by the support of the home crowd.
