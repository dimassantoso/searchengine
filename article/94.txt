Invaluable experience for next generation at World Junior Championships

Invaluable experience and a ninth-place team finish came the way of England’s next generation of badminton talent following a busy week at the World Junior Championships.

Taking to the courts of Yogyakarta, Indonesia, all new experiences fell on young shoulders as the best in the world convened for the week-long competition – the highlight of the junior year.

And with a top-ten finish secured for the team, plenty of positives were able to be taken from the Championships, with each of those competing hoping for big things in 2018.

Everyone taking part in the men’s singles went beyond the first round, while Johnnie Torjussen impressed to reach the fourth round before being knocked out by fourth seed and eventual runner-up Jun Hao Leong.

The women’s singles also saw Abigail Holden battle through two victories, conceding just 39 points in her first four games of the competition.

Each of the three mixed doubles pairs celebrated at least one victory in Indonesia, while Rory Easton and Harry Huang impressed in the men’s doubles to knock out a seeded pair.

Holden was also in women’s doubles action, though she and Freya Redfearn were prevented from progressing by 13th seeds Rin Iwanaga and Natsu Saito.

The next big tournament for England's juniors will be the European U17 Championships, which take place from November 21-29.
