Lin Dan still the best, says badminton great Gade

Lin Dan's return to the All-England Open for the first time in three years on Wednesday should show, despite his spasmodic appearances these days, that he is still the world's best player.

In the process, the Olympic champion from China could help the famous 116-year-old tournament clarify the confused picture at the top of the men's game, at a time when the new Olympic qualifying period is only a few weeks away.

So says Peter Gade, the former world number one and the last European to win the All-England men's singles, who insists that badminton needs a period of competitive stability which Lin Dan and this year's All-England might help provide.
