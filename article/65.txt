Chen Long and Yamaguchi bag titles in contrasting fashion

PETALING JAYA: Chen Long of China and Japanese Akane Yamaguchi captured their first Superseries titles this year in contrasting styles at the China Open.

World No. 5 Chen Long was stretched to the limit before beating reigning world champion Viktor Axelsen of Denmark 21-16, 14-21, 21-13 in the men’s singles final at the Haixia Olympic Sports Centre in Fuzhou yesterday.

Chen Long, 28, had reached only one Superseries final this year at the Australian Open but lost to K. Srikanth of India.

In contrast, world No. 4 Yamaguchi showed no mercy in her 21-13, 21-15 win over Gao Fangjie of China in the women’s singles final.


Yesterday’s win should propel Yamaguchi back to the world No. 1 spot.

She is now behind leader Tai Tzu-ying of Taiwan, P.V. Sindhu of India and Sung Ji-yun of South Korea.
