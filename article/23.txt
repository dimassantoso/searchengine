Susi Susanti

Badminton was only granted Olympic status at the 1992 Olympic Games of Barcelona and it was fitting that the first Olympic champion be one of the most dominating players of all-time. Indonesian badminton queen, Susanti, became Indonesiaâs first-ever gold-medalist beating [Bang Su-Hyeon] of Korea in the womenâs singles final. Two hours later, her fiancÃ© (now husband) [Alan Budikusuma] won the menâs singles title. This talented couple arrived home to Indonesia following the Olympic Games elevated in popularity beyond their already rock-star status and were both rewarded financially by the government for bringing so much pride and joy to their country. Four years later, Bang got revenge on Susanti at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, as she had spent time watching video of Susanti's play and used the knowledge to beat the Indonesian 11-9, 11-8 and reach the gold medal finals in women's play, sending Susanti home with the bronze medal.

So admired was Susanti in Indonesia, the Olympic and World champion hoped that the birth of her first child in 1999 would bring peace to her country, which had been rocked by a series of civil outbreaks and violence. She offered her first child born in 1999 as the âChild of Peaceâ for this populous nation, and so named her Laurencia Averina Wiratama, which means âpeaceâ. Now parents of three, Susi and Alan own a badminton club in Jakarta Udara, and in 2004, they established the ASTEC (Alan and Susy Technology), a sport equipment corporation.
