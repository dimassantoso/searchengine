Europeans climbing 

Bulgaria's Stoeva sisters are back to top 10 on the women doubles world ranking list this week. Stefani and Gabriela are now aiming to keep that position and climb even higher. 

"We are very happy to be back in top 10. We are aiming for good results at Superseries events because we have shown good performances. But still the results are missing so we are focusing on that now.", the sisters tell Badminton Europe

Anders Antonsen climbed three spots up to occupy the 14th place on men's singles world ranking list this week. The young Dane reached the semi-finals last week, at the French Open. 

His compatriot Hans-Kristian Solberg Vittinghus moved one spot up and is now ranked no. 21 in the world. For the sixth consecutive week, the world champion Viktor Axelsen is leading the men's singles world ranking list with 77930 points. 

The new ranking list has Vladimir Ivanov/Ivan Sozonov (Russia) on the 12th place on the men's doubles world ranking list. French Open runner-ups Mathias Boe and Carsten Mogensen (Denmark) are confidently sitting on the second place for the sixth consecutive week.
