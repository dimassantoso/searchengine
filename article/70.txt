Saina Nehwal set to climb back into the top 10 of the BWF world rankings

The BWF World Rankings list that will release on Thursday, November 23, 2017, will see a lot of shuffle. Among the big changes, former World No. 1 Saina Nehwal is all set to climb back into the top 10 in contrast to which, PV Sindhu and Srikanth Kidambi will slip down the ladder.

Former China Open champion Nehwal bettered her 2016 result in Fuzhou and added 4320 points this time by dint of her second round appearance at the Superserier Premier tournament that concluded last week. It will enable her to have a total points tally of 56160 and will place her at the 10th position, six months after she left the top 10.
