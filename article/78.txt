Ginting takes maiden title in Korea

Anthony Sinisuka Ginting claimed his maiden international title at the Korea Open SuperSeries on Sunday after overcoming Jonathan Christie in a tight, all-Indonesian men’s singles final in Seoul.

The 24th-ranked Ginting took the first game 21-13, before Christie fought back to take the second 19-21.

Ginting, who had caused an upset a day earlier when he beat world number one and local favourite Son Wan-Ho, wasn’t to be denied though, and found something extra as the deciding set went down to the wire before he eventually took it 22-20 to clinch the title in 68 minutes.

In the women’s event, India’s PV Sundhu took the honours after beating Nozomi Okuhara to gain revenge for her defeat in last month’s World Championship final.

Olympic silver medallist Sindhu, overcame world champion Okuhara 22-20, 11-21, 21-18 after an hour and 23 minutes on court.
