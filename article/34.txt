Hong Kong pair win Denmark Open title

ODENSE: Shuttlers Tang Chun Man-Tse Ying Suet continued their fairy-tale run at the Denmark Open by lifting their first Superseries title.

On Saturday, Chun Man-Ying Suet had upset Indonesians Tontowi Ahmad-Liliyana Natsir 21-16, 21-18 in the semi-finals.

"Weâ€™ve never reached a Superseries final before. Now, we have beaten all the top pairs to win our first title. The Denmark Open will always be special to us," said the 22-year-old Chun Man, who teamed up with Ying Suet in June last year.
