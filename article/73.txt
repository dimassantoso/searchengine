Lin Dan crashes out on home soil

Five-time World champion Lin Dan was knocked out of the China Open in the first round on Wednesday.

Lin saved seven match points as he tried to avoid defeat by Indonesian World No 17 Jonatan Christie, but ultimately went down 21-19, 21-16.

The defeat will raise speculation that the 34-year-old may be nearing the end of his glittering career.

Lin's performance against Cristie was filled with errors, resulting in a shock upset in front of his home crowd in Fuzhou.

"When we shook hands before the match I felt his hand was cold and I sensed he was nervous," Cristie said after the match.

"I realised that even though he was a past World and Olympic champion, he could get nervous too, so that made me confident."

Cristie added: "One of the best days of my life, I beat Lin Dan at his home crowd."

Elsewhere, Lin's great rival Lee Chong Wei had better fortunes, dismissing Taiwan's Hsu Jen-hao 21-5, 21-7 to power into the second round.

Others to advance inlucded Viktor Axelsen, Son Wan Ho, Chou Tien Chen and Chen Long.

There were no major upsets in the women's draw, with top seed Tai Tzu Ying, PV Sindhu, SUng Ji Hyun and Carolina Marin all making it safely through.
