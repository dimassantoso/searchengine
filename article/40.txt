"To win Worlds, LCW needs to change his game" – Hendrawan

National badminton hero Datuk Lee Chong Wei must be able to change his game for the upcoming Badminton World Federation World Championships in order to finally win the event.

According to national singles coach Hendrawan, Lee Chong Wei will be willing to make changes in his training regime to ensure the player will be unrecognizable in Glasgow.

The world number one lost to rival Lin Dan twice in recent times, in the Malaysian Open final and the Badminton Asia Championships (BAC) semi-final, and Hendrawan believes that Lin Dan’s explosive approach to the game is what makes him different than everyone else.

"I noticed that Lin Dan changed his game during the previous events and I spoke with Tey Seu Bock and it is best that he (Lee) tries new things as well," he said as quoted by Utusan.

Hendrawan also mentioned that Lee Chong Wei will be urging to win a major championship especially after falling a number of times at the Olympic Games and World Championships.

"Lee Chong Wei is a fighter and his spirit will allow him to win the event in the end."
