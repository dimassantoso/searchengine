End of the road for Chong Wei in China

Lee Chong Wei’s disappointing run of form continued as he went down to Angus Ng Ka Long in the quarter-finals of the China Open.

The former World No 1 showed some encouraging signs with his two opening wins in the tournament, but was beaten in three tight games by Long on Friday.

Long triumphed 21-12, 15-21, 21-19 after one hour and 11 minutes to set up a semi-final meeting with top seed Viktor Axelsen, who advanced after beating Chou Tien Chen 21-17, 21-14.

The battle between Chong Wei and Long went right down to the wire, but in the end it was the Hong Kong shuttler who won the points that mattered at the death.

The second men’s semi-final sees Home favourite Chen Long take on second seed Son Wan Ho.

Chen defeated countryman Shi Yuqi, 21-13, 16-21, 21-14, while Son ended the run of qualifier Lee Cheuk Yiu with a 21-14, 12-21, 21-18 victory.

The women’s draw saw a big win for Thailand’s Ratchanok Intanon, as she defeated top seed and World No 1 Tai Tzu Ying 10-21, 21-9, 22-20.

Intanon moves on to face Akane Yamaguchi, while the second semi-final pits fourth seed Carolina Marin against qualifier Gao Fangjie, after the Chinese player upset second seed PV Sindhu of India 21-11, 21-10.
