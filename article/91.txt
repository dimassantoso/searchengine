Viktor Axelsen has stormed into the China Open final with a 21-12, 21-17 win over Ng Ka Long Angus of Hong Kong. Axelsen (23) will face Chen Long in Sunday’s final, the world No.1 chasing his fourth Superseries title.

World No 1 Viktor Axelsen of Denmark will play the reigning Olympic champion and Chinese superstar Chen Long in Sunday's mouth-watering final of the 700.000 Dollars event in Fuzhou.

Axelsen, the current world champion and top seed in China, needed just 39 minutes to defeat unseeded Ng Ka Long Angus of Hong Kong 21-12, 21-17 in their one-sided semi-final on Saturday. Axelsen is just one win away from his maiden China Open triumph.

"It feels good. It’s always nice to play finals at big Superseries tournaments. I am looking forward to going on court tomorrow. It's a new game tomorrow. I believe I'll have a chance - but Chen Long is playing really well this week. It’ll be great to play in front of a Chinese audience", Axelsen said to DR Sporten.

Chen Long, 28, holds a strong advantage in his meetings with Axelsen, beating the Dane seven times and losing to him only once.

Current Olympic champion Carolina Marin of Spain was stunned by 19-year-old Gao Fangjie 21-19, 21-19 in one hour.
