Conrad: There must be a mistake Date

Mads Conrad-Petersen and Mads Pieler Kolding were up against their Danish colleagues Mathias Boe and Carsten Mogensen, in the quarter-final at China Open.

For the third time in 2017, the two pairs faced each other in a Superseries quarter-final. But for the first time this year, Conrad and Kolding took the first set; 23-21. But in the end the scale tipped for Boe and Mogensenâ€™s favor and they managed to win the next two sets; 23-21, 21-19.

Today was is the small things. We made too many unprovoked errors in the middle of both sets which kept us behind all the time. On the contrary, we were sharp in the end of the sets which kept us in the game, and when it is tie at 19-19 it is like a lottery, Mads Conrad said to Badminton Europe.

When we are measureing ourselves to Boe and Nuller, we are close to the best and that is satisfiying when we look back on how we performed at Denmark and French Open.
