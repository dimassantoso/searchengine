How did you get started as a badminton player for Indonesia and who/what was your main motivator?

When I was young, my dream was to become a football player. Sadly, this dream was forbidden by my dad because I kept falling sick due to all the training. He was so much against it that he destroyed my football which it had painstakingly saved up to buy.

Then my dad introduced me to badminton, and I gradually began to enjoy the sport. After practising the sport for some time, my dad gave me the suggestion that if I wanted to be an athlete in Indonesia, I should be a badminton athlete because of Indonesia’s reputation for producing world-class badminton players.

I sharpened my skills in badminton after my father’s advice and encouragement. I started to train seriously and eventually joined the SGS PLN Bandung Club at the young age of nine. I was trained by Lie Sumirat. From there, I started joining badminton tournaments and was selected to join Peltnas Cipayung as a junior player at 13 years of age. I won my first title at the Asia Junior Championship in 1997.
