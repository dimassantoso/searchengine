Zii Jia through to Bitburger Open semis

PETALING JAYA: Young shuttler Lee Zii Jia kept the Malaysian flag flying after edging Frenchman Brice Leverdez in the quarter-finals of the Bitburger Open in Germany.

The 19-year-old showed maturity that belied his tender years as he stunned the third seeded Leverdez 19-21, 21-18, 21-10 at the Saarlandhalle Arena on Friday (Nov 3).

The win earned the world No. 55 a third semi-final appearance in a GP Gold event.

The national No. 2 will meet Denmark's Rasmus Gemke for a place in the final.
