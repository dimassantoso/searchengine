Lee/Lee On Target

Lee Jhe-Huei and Lee Yang were in their first final of this level, facing a pair that has seen many such occasions – Denmark’s Mathias Boe and Carsten Mogensen. Yet, it was the younger pair that demonstrated greater composure when it mattered.

In both games, the Taiwanese were required to keep their wits about them as the wily Danes edged close. Their attack though was fierce and on target, and the Danes found themselves constantly on the defensive. The Taiwanese saved one game point before converting their own second match point for a 21-19 23-21 result. The day’s second title for Chinese Taipei meant that it was their most successful Superseries.

"We constantly had to talk to each other as it was such a big occasion and I was nervous," said Lee Jhe-Huei. "It means a lot to win our first Superseries title. We are doubly happy that our country won two titles today."
