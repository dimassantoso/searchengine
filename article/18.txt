I'd still rule badminton today if I were in my prime, says Hartono

Indonesian great believes â€¨he would rule badminton if he were in his prime today

He holds the record for the number of men's singles titles at the All England Open Badminton Championships, winning seven straight from 1968 to 1974 and adding an eighth in 1976.

And legendary Indonesian shuttler Rudy Hartono, regarded by many as one of the greatest in history, believes he would still rule the sport if he were in his prime today.

The 66-year-old was in town at the invitation of the local Badminton Coaches Association to speak at its inaugural Coaches Seminar at the Civil Service Club's Tessensohn clubhouse yesterday.

When The New Paper asked him if he would be No. 1 today: "It depends. If I prepare well, in terms of physical fitness, mental strength and technical strategy, then I would have the confidence to win.

"So I can say yes."

Hartono was the undisputed king of his era.

At the 1972 Olympics in Munich, he eased to victory by beating Dane Svend Pri 15-6, 15-1 in the final, although badminton was only a demonstration sport at the Games then.

It only became an official Olympic sport at the 1992 Games in Barcelona.

In his only crack at the World Championships in 1980, Hartono claimed the title at the ripe old age of 31.

By then, he was far past his prime.
