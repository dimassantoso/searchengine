Thailand land in-demand Rexy as head coach

PETALING JAYA: Former Olympic badminton champion Rexy Mainaky (pic) is certainly a coach in demand.

He has been appointed as head coach of Thailand after his tenure with Indonesia ended last month. Susi Susanti, the 1992 Barcelona Olympics women’s singles champion, is now Indonesia’s head coach.

"I will be starting work in Thailand on Jan 5.

"I have signed a three-year contract," said 48-year-old Rexy, who was Malaysia’s doubles coach for seven years before leaving in 2012.


"I had several offers after my tenure with Indonesia ended last month.

"But I picked Thailand as I like the challenge," said Rexy, who won the 1996 Olympic men’s doubles gold with Ricky Subagja.
