Peter Gade quits as French national coach

Peter Gade announced today that he would not continue in the role as national coach of France.

"I will stop my position as national coach for France on May 1st 2018. In mutual agreement with FFBAD, I have been taking a lot of different aspects into consideration for making the best future scenario for French badminton, and for myself. We decided that May 2018 will be the end of this cooperation. The same goes for my compatriot and assistant coach, Jesper Hovgaard who’s been a crucial and very important part of the effort we’ve put in for the last 2,5 years, trying to implement culture and structure for French badminton to build on for a promising future."

The Danish former Yonex All-England champion Gade added:

"I will continue to give my outmost best in bringing the best possible improvement and results for the French players until my departure. What will be next in my life, I don’t know yet, but badminton will for sure play a part. In which way - I don’t know yet.“

Former world number one Peter Gade commenced his position with the French Badminton Federation on 15th of May 2015.

Gade, 40, is one of the world's best badminton players of all time. The Dane won the European Championships five times and took five World Championship medals between 1999 and 2011. 

From 1997 to 2001, Gade was ranked number one in the BWF world ranking. In 1999, he won the prestigious Yonex All-England Championships.
