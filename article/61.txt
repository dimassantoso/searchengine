Marcus and Kevin win Japan Open superseries

World number two pair Marcus Fernaldi Gideon and Kevin Sanjaya Sukamuljo won the 2017 Japan Open badminton tournament on Sunday – their fourth superseries title this year.

The Indonesians overpowered hosts Takuto Inoue and Yuki Kaneko 21-12, 21-15 in just 30 minutes, in Sunday’s final held at the Tokyo Metropolitan Gymnasium.

“We performed quite well overall,” said Marcus, as quoted by badmintonindonesia.org after the match.

“We started a bit wobbly, maybe because of the court or the shuttlecock, which was different than the ones at the Korea Open [last week],” he added.

At the Korea Open, Marcus and Kevin finished as the runners-up after being beaten by world number one pair Mathias Boe and Carsten Mogensen of Denmark. In Tokyo, however, the Indonesians crushed the Danes in the semifinals.

Prior to the Japan Open, Marcus and Kevin won the All England, India Open and Malaysia Open.
