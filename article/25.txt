Chong Wei loses in French Open's first round

PETALING JAYA: Lee Chong Wei's woes in Europe have continued after he was sent packing in the first round of the French Open.

The three-time Olympic silver medallist was a surprising second round loser at the Denmark Open last week, falling in three games to H.S. Prannoy of India.

And it didn't get any better for the 35-year-old after he suffered a 14-21, 15-21 thrashing at the hands of unheralded Japanese shuttler Kenta Nishimoto.
