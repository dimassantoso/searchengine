Tontowi-Liliyana happy to see Praveen-Debby stepping up

SHAH ALAM: Indonesian mixed doubles pair Tontowi Ahmad-Liliyana Natsir are glad to finally have some familiar faces for company at the top of the world ranking.

The world No. 2 and 2013 world champions are delighted to see compatriots Praveen Jordan-Debby Susanto, ranked No. 7 in the world.

Despite being paired up just two years ago, Praveen-Debby made their first major breakthrough by winning the All-England last month.

"It's a positive sign to see Praveen-Debby come up so fast. They haven't been playing together for that along," said the 30-year-old Liliyana.

"Previously, everyone expected us to fight for honours in competitions. Now that Praveen-Debby are in the top 10, it takes some load off our shoulders."

With Praveen-Debby rising fast up the ranking, Tontowi-Liliyana are ready to step up their hunt for the elusive Olympic gold medal.

The pair, who have not won a Superseries title since the French Open in 2014, seem to be on the right path judging by their strong start in the Celcom Axiata Malaysian Open.

The second seeds were imperious en route to beating China's young pair of Wang Yilyu-Chen Qingchen 21-18, 21-14.

"Our opponents may be young, but they have the mentality of champions ... they won the Swiss Open last month, after all," said Liliyana.

"We're more prepared this time compared to the Malaysian Masters (In January), when we lost in the first round."

Tontowi-Liliyana will take on Germans Michael Fuchs-Birgit Michels next.

Praveen-Debby, who are seeded eighth, also made a solid start by whipping Japan's Kenta Kazuno-Ayane Kurihara 21-14, 21-15.

Malaysian No. 1 mixed doubles pair Chan Peng Soon-Goh Liu Ying kept their recent good form going by beating Indonesians Riky Widianto-Puspita Richi Dili 21-15, 21-18.

The New Zealand Open winners will face fifth seeds Xu Chen-Ma Jin of China for a place in the last eight.
