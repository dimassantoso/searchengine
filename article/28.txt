Hong Kong Open: Indian shuttlers look to make amends

HYDERABAD: Smarting from their worst performance in the last eight months at the China Open, the Indians will be keen to make amends at the Hong Kong Super Series beginning in Kowloon on Tuesday. For the first time since Sai Praneeth won the Singapore Open on April 16, Indians didn't progress beyond the quarters in China. PV Sindhu was the sole exception, reaching quarters.

Having won seven Super Series titles and six Grand Prix Gold crowns this year, Indians have emerged as one of the top nations this year but the move to force them play the Nationals appears to have backfired. The shuttlers have been playing non-stop badminton since October 17, travelling from Europe to India and then China to feature in six tournaments. The poor show in China could mean HS Prannoy and Saina Nehwal may miss out on qualification for the Super Series Finals next month.

Many feel K Srikanth has played it smart by opting out of two tournaments to be fresh for the Finals in December. Barring Sindhu, most of the Indians have a tough draw at the Hong Kong Open. Sindhu begins against a qualifier and is expected to reach the quarterfinals. The second-seeded Indian may face Akane Yamaguchi of Japan in last eight. Yamaguchi won the China Open last week and has toyed with Sindhu and Saina in the last two months.
