Statement: Badminton England commitment to diversity

With over 185 nations within the membership of the Badminton World Federation (BWF), Badminton is recognised as a global sport and that worldwide appeal is reflected in those taking part in badminton in England. 

Badminton England also celebrates the inclusivity and diversity of its membership – being a sport played by those from primary school age to the older population and from all sections of society.

Badminton England strives to ensure that the diverse representation of those taking part in badminton is reflected across its governance structure and welcomes the Code for Sports Governance and its requirement that “Organisations shall recruit and engage people with appropriate diversity, independence, skills, experience and knowledge to take effective decisions that further the organisation’s goals”.

Badminton England has made significant progress in recent years in recruiting greater female representation to its Board of Directors.

The female representation on the Board (40%) currently exceeds the requirements in the Code of Sports Governance; that being a minimum of 30% of each gender on the Board.

However, Badminton England remains committed to making further progress by working towards gender parity on the Board and also to ensure that the composition of the Board better reflects the diversity of those taking part in the sport in England.

In doing so it will ensure that Board members possess the skills and experience necessary to deliver its strategic plan and to ensure good governance.  This requirement is reflected in the terms of reference of Badminton England’s Nominations Committee when recruiting and making recommendations for new members of the Board, and will remain under regular scrutiny.
