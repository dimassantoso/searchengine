Guess who’s the mastermind behind India’s singles success?

ODENSE: Indonesian Mulyo Handoyo, the coach of former great Taufik Hidayat, is behind the recent success of India’s singles shuttlers.

On Sunday, K. Srikanth bagged his third Superseries title of the year when he crushed Lee Hyun-il of South Korea 21-10, 21-5 in the men’s singles final of the Denmark Open at the Odense Sports Park.

Besides world No. 8 Srikanth, three other Indians – H.S. Prannoy (14th), B. Sai Praneeth (16th) and Sameer Verma (19th) – are also in the world’s top 20.

All of them have won titles this season with Prannoy having scored impressive wins over Malaysian Lee Chong Wei at the Indonesian Open and Denmark Open.


"We hired Mulyo early this year and I’m happy with the progress shown by our men’s singles players," said Gopichand.

Besides Mulyo, India also engaged former Malaysian international Tan Kim Her to beef up their doubles department last year.
